## How to roll dices?

Just use the ordinary abreviations of dice rolls from the traditional RPG systems after a "!". Like this "!2d6" (without the quotes) to roll 2 six-sided dices, for example. The bot is able to roll until 9 dices each time. And the available dices are: d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 and d%. What are pretty much all the common dices in RPG games. 

Important to say, if you want to roll a single dice, you still need to add the number of dices in the command. Like this "!1d20". Otherwise the bot will not understand you. You know... machines...

## Wait, but what is RPG?
Oh! I think I should start from there so... RPG stands for *role-playing game*. I like to explain it as a game of telling stories. Normally, one player is the *Game Master* which will set up the scenario, the *Non-player Characters* (the Villan, the allies...) and the background story. The other players role-plays the heros. So, depending on the decisions and actions of each player the story may take different plot lines. 

About the dices, they are just a way to spice the things up with some randomicity...

If you are new to RPGs maybe you need a little more then this poor explanation. There are great RPGs out there like [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com/), [Cyberpunk](https://rtalsoriangames.com/cyberpunk/) or [Call  of Cthulhu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/). One of them may be your cup of tea.
